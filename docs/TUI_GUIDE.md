```

5. Press `Enter` to install

### Install multiple components with search
1. Run `./cct`
2. Select "Commands"
3. Press `/` to search
4. Type "security"
5. Use `Space` to select multiple security-related commands
6. Press `Enter` twice to confirm and install

### Browse and explore
1. Run `./cct`
2. Navigate through different component types
3. Use `Esc` to go back without installing
4. Press `Q` to quit

## Troubleshooting

### TUI doesn't launch
- Ensure your terminal supports ANSI colors
- Try a different terminal emulator (iTerm2, Alacritty recommended)
- Check that terminal size is adequate (minimum 80x24)

### Components don't load
- Check internet connection
- Verify GitHub API access (rate limits may apply)
- Try again in a few minutes if rate limited

### Installation fails
- Verify write permissions in target directory
- Check disk space
- Ensure `.claude` directory is writable

## Technical Details

### Built With
- **Bubble Tea** - TUI framework by Charm
- **Lipgloss** - Terminal styling
- **Bubbles** - TUI components (textinput, spinner)

### Component Sources
Components are loaded dynamically from:
- Repository: `davila7/claude-code-templates`
- Branch: `main`
- Path: `cli-tool/components/`

### Installation Structure
```
.claude/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [agent-name].md
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [command-name].md
â””â”€â”€ mcp/
    â””â”€â”€ [mcp-name].json
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use search** - With 600+ agents and 200+ commands, search is your friend
2. **Select multiple** - Use `a` to select all filtered results when searching
3. **Explore categories** - Components are organized by category for easy browsing
4. **Check completion screen** - Review results before exiting to ensure success
5. **Return to main menu** - Press `R` on completion screen to install more components

## Fallback to CLI Flags

The original CLI flag interface is still available:

```bash
# Install agent
./cct --agent security-auditor

# Install multiple components
./cct --agent api-tester --command deploy --mcp postgresql

# Install with comma-separated lists
./cct --agent "security-auditor,code-reviewer"
```

The TUI is designed for interactive browsing, while flags are ideal for automation and scripts.
